// ----- ReCraft ----- //

Mod which expands on vanilla features which would add blocks, add variations to balanced gear, food, etc.

Ingot/Ores + Tools/Armor added:
Copper - Tools/Armor are better overall than stone, but worse than Iron
Rose Gold - Tools/Armor are more durable than gold, less so over Iron, but do lack some of the speed that gold tools provide, but still faster than Iron. Gold and Copper combined create Rose Gold ingots, where as Gold tools can be upgraded with a smithing table using Copper to create Rose Gold tools/armor, retaining any enchantments already on golden tools.
Steel - Tools/Armor are more durable than iron, less so than diamond and they have additional armor toughness. Steel is made by smelting Iron again - Gives a good middle-ground between iron and diamond tools especially with mods like "TuffDepth", when getting diamonds in caves proves to be a difficult task without the added durability and stats of Steel.

Building Blocks added:
Charcoal Block - Crafted using charcoal to create a block that can smelt 80 items.
Frosted Glass + Panes - Crafted using new item called Glass Dust.
Stained/Frosted Cracked Glass + Panes - Crafted by smelting any stained glass in furnace.
Framed Stained/Frosted Glass + Panes - Crafted with iron ingot and glass, with dye applied after the creation of Framed Glass.
Glowglass - Crafted with glass dust and glow stone dust, with dye applied during or after creation.

Items added:
Glass Shard - Obtained from any glass (+stained) blocks when broken by hand, or with fortune enchantment. This is used to craft new glass blocks, much like how Glowstone Dust is used to make Glowstone.
Glass Dust - Obtained from any frosted glass blocks when broken by hand, or with fortune enchantment. This is used to craft new frosted glass blocks.
Stitched Rotten Flesh - Crafted from 4 rotten flesh and string, used to create leather after cured in smoker.

Food Added:
Golden Baked Potato - High saturation.
Golden Beetroot - Provides good saturation and fire resistance.
Golden Beetroot Soup - Provides good saturation and long-duration fire resistance.
Golden Bread - High saturation.
Golden Chorus Fruit - Provides good saturation and levitation effect.
Golden Cooked Beef - Very high saturation.
Golden Cooked Chicken - Provides good saturation and slow falling.
Golden Cooked Cod - Provides good saturation, dolphins grace and water breathing.
Golden Cooked Mutton - Very high saturation.
Golden Cooked Porkchop - Very high saturation.
Golden Cooked Rabbit - Provides good saturation and jump boost.
Golden Cooked Salmon - Provides good saturation, long-duration dolphins grace and water breathing.
Golden Glow Berries - Provides good saturation and haste.
Golden Pumpkin Pie - Provides good saturation and night vision.
Golden Sweet Berries - Provides good saturation and speed.

World Generation:
Steel - Added steel netherrack generation to the Nether dimension - fairly rare, but you will spot it here and there in small veins. They behave like Gold netherrack blocks, providing some exp and nuggets dropped with regular tools/fortune enchantments.
